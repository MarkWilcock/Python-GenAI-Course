Each couple is scored by a panel of judges. The title of the show is a continuation of the long-running series Come Dancing. The format has been exported to 60 other countries under the title Dancing with the Stars, licensed by BBC Worldwide, and led to a modern dance-themed spin-off Strictly Dance Fever. The Guinness World Records named Strictly as the world\\'s most successful reality television format in 2010.[8] The series is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman. Bruce Forsyth co-presented the series with Daly until 2014.\\nThe series has been broadcast on BBC One since 15 May 2004, typically on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show. From series 2 onwards, the show has been broadcast in the run up to Christmas.  With its high viewing figures, Strictly Come Dancing has become a significant programme on British television.[9] Eighteen stand-alone Christmas specials and nineteen charity specials have also been produced.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment\\nProducer Richard Hopkins, who had produced the first UK series of Big Brother, unsuccessfully pitched the idea of a modern Come Dancing to the BBC under the title of Pro-Celebrity Dancing in 2003.[10] Later, entertainment executive Fenia Vardanis also suggested reviving Come Dancing, so Jane Lush, the then head of BBC Entertainment, put Hopkins and Vardanis together to develop the show.[10]\\nHopkins then called in Karen Smith, who had just produced Comic Relief Does Fame Academy for BBC One and The Games for Channel 4, to help lead the development of the show and launch the series. Smith was the show-running Executive Producer of the first three series, and of sister show It Takes Two.[11] She then took the role of Creative Director of BBC Entertainment whilst still overseeing series 4 and 5.[12][13]\\nHopkins later took the format to America himself when the BBC dismissed the idea of selling it abroad, as they felt it was too British.[14]\\nThe title is an amalgamation of the titles of the 1992 Australian film Strictly Ballroom and Come Dancing.\\n\\nFormat\\nFrom series 1 to 11, Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly presented the pro-celebrity ballroom dancing competition. From series 8 to 11, Forsyth only presented the main show and was replaced for the results show by Claudia Winkleman, at which point Daly assumed Forsyth\\'s role as main presenter and Winkleman assumed Daly\\'s role as co-presenter. Winkleman joined Daly as full-time co-presenter for series 12 following Forsyth\\'s departure after the 2013 series. Through telephone voting, viewers vote for who they would like to be in the next round, the results of the poll being combined with the ranking of the judges. For example, with ten contestants left, the judges\\' favourite would receive ten points, second favourite nine points, and so on, and similarly with the viewers\\' rankings. The bottom ranked couple gets one point.[15] The profits from the telephone lines were donated to Sport Relief in series 1, to Children in Need from series 2, until series 8 when donations to charity stopped.\\nThe show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (with Zoe Ball covering for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show.[16] For most of the second series, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood. Alesha Dixon took Phillips\\' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge Britain\\'s Got Talent which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her.[17] Goodman left the show after the 2016 series and was replaced by Shirley Ballas. Bussell remained as judge until 2018, and was replaced by Motsi Mabuse in 2019. Up until 2020, Tonioli commuted weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously- however, due the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, he could no longer juggle both the UK and US shows- he was not replaced for the 2020 series; but pro dancer Anton Du Beke took his place from the 2021 series, and has now replaced Tonioli full-time on the panel. The current judging panel consists of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke, making Horwood the only judge to remain with the programme since its inception. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is Alan Dedicoat. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast \"as live\" on the Sunday.\\nThe singers on the show are Tommy Blaize, Hayley Sanderson, Lance Ellington, Andrea Grant and, formerly, the well-known British dance music vocalist Tara McDonald. The music director is David Arch. Tommy Blaize has been part of Strictly since its beginning. David Arch joined in the fourth series and Hayley Sanderson in the fifth. The original musical director from series 1 to 3 was Laurie Holloway. In the seventeenth series, the singers were joined by Mitchell.[18]\\nThe show was broadcast from a specially constructed set at BBC Television Centre (primarily in the largest studio, TC1[19]) until its closure in 2013, with the show moving to Elstree Studios\\' George Lucas Stage 2 from 2013 onwards. However, in the first two series, shows were also filmed at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool, where the original Come Dancing series was filmed in the 1970s.[20][21]\\nIn the second series, two shows were filmed at the Tower Ballroom — show five and the Grand Final, which was broadcast live on 11 December 2004.[22][23] In 2005 though the BBC announced that they would not be returning to the venue for the third series due to \"logistical problems\".[24] In October 2008, Craig Revel Horwood called for the series to return to the Tower Ballroom, saying, \"The atmosphere was electric. It\\'s huge and has so much history. The Tower Ballroom puts a lot of pressure on the professionals and the celebrities to perform to the best of their potential. What a wonderful place to go live to 12 million people. We have got to get the BBC to bring Strictly Come Dancing back to Blackpool.\" Eventually, for series 7, the show did return to the Tower Ballroom, where Blackpool-born Craig Kelly was eliminated. The episode was aired live on 7 November 2009.[25] Strictly Come Dancing returned to Blackpool for the 2010[26] and 2011 series.[27] After series 10, when Strictly Come Dancing did not go to Blackpool, they announced that they would return for series 11.[28]\\n\\nCast\\nPresenters and judges\\nColor key\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0Host\\n\\xa0\\xa0It Takes Two host\\n\\xa0\\xa0Judge\\n\\xa0\\xa0Guest

partnerships. Darren Bennett and Lilia Kopylova are married,[29] as are James and Ola Jordan.[30] Aljaž Škorjanec and Janette Manrara, who became engaged after joining the show in 2013, were married in 2017.[31] Matthew and Nicole Cutler are divorced, but remain professional partners;[32][33] Karen Hauer and Kevin Clifton were engaged when Clifton entered the show in 2013 and were married prior to the 2015 series, before divorcing in 2018, while Neil and Katya Jones entered the show as a married couple before separating in 2019. Anton Du Beke and Erin Boag have danced as a professional couple since 1997,[34] while Vincent Simone and Flavia Cacace are former Argentine tango world champions as a duo and have done multiple tours together.[35] Brendan Cole and Camilla Dallerup danced together for many years, including a stint on the original series of Come Dancing;[36][37] following their split in 2004, Cole and Katya Virshilas formed a professional partnership before splitting in November 2009.[38][39][40] Other current and former professional partnerships featured on the show include Dallerup and Ian Waite, Paul Killick and Hanna Karttunen,[41] Andrew Cuerden and Hanna Haarala, Brian Fortuna and Kristina Rihanoff, Rihanoff and Robin Windsor,[42] Pasha Kovalev and Anya Garnis,[43][44] siblings Kevin and Joanne Clifton,[45] AJ Pritchard and Chloe Hewitt, and Gorka Márquez and Karen Hauer.[46][47]\\n\\nPresentation\\nDances\\nOn average, dances last for approximately 90 seconds.[48] Musical accompaniment is provided by The Strictly Come Dancing Band.\\n\\nResults show\\nFrom series 1 to 4, the results show was shown live on Saturday night one hour after the performances.\\nAs of series 5, the results show is recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show and incorporates the result of the viewers\\' votes, which are completed by 21:30. This was confirmed by the official BBC website in 2008:\\n\\nThe Sunday show is recorded on Saturday night but no element involving the results of the vote will start recording until after lines are closed and votes counted and verified.[49]\\nThroughout the Sunday results show, the presenters refer to \\'Saturday night\\' in reference to the main show due to the timing of the Sunday programme, and the outfits of Tess Daly, Claudia Winkleman and the judges are changed to present an illusion of a second live broadcast.\\nFor series 7, the Sunday results show was axed and put back to Saturday nights as a result of a revamp of the show.[50] It then reverted to Sundays from series 8.\\n\\nDance-off\\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\\nA new system called the Dance-off, which takes place in the results show, was introduced in series 5. It continued until series 7, but did not return in series 8. It was then reinstated in series 10 and has remained a feature of the show ever since.\\nThe Dance-off consists of the two couples who received the lowest totals that week from the combined judges\\' scores and public vote. The aim of the dance-off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week\\'s competition. Before they attempt their dance a second time, the couples sometimes get advice from the judges. The judges then decide which couple remains in the competition based on the dance-off performances. If three of the judges agree that one of the couples should be saved, that couple is through to the following week\\'s competition and the Head Judge\\'s vote is not counted. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the deciding vote is cast by the head judge, originally Len Goodman and currently Shirley Ballas. Afterwards, the eliminated couple perform one final dance — sometimes known as \"waltzing out of the ballroom\". The Monday after their elimination, they appear on It Takes Two to discuss their time on the programme.\\nOn two occasions, the dance-off was cancelled; firstly, in series 14, in which one of the celebrity contestants, Anastacia, sustained an injury and was unable to compete in the Dance-off as a result. Under the rules of the show, the couple with the lowest combined total was eliminated. The second occasion in which the Dance-off was cancelled was in Series 20, again due to an injury sustained by Tony Adams. Tess Daly announced on the results show that Adams had decided to withdraw from the competition as a result of being unable to compete in the Dance-off.\\n\\nIt Takes Two\\nMain article: Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two\\nDuring the run of Strictly Come Dancing, Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two is broadcast each weeknight on BBC Two. The series was previously hosted by Claudia Winkleman but, due to her pregnancy in 2011, she had to leave the series, and was replaced by Zoe Ball, who hosted the show from Series 9 to 18.[51] Rylan Clark-Neal joined as co-host in series 17. In May 2021, it was announced that Ball was to leave the show after 10 years, and on 10 June 2021, her replacement was confirmed to be former professional Janette Manrara.[52]\\nThe show features reviews of the performances during the previous Saturday\\'s show and interviews with, and training footage of, the couples preparing for the next show. The judges and other celebrities also provide their opinions on how the couples are progressing. It Takes Two replaced Strictly Come Dancing on Three, hosted by Justin Lee Collins, which ran on BBC Three during the first series. Prior to 2010, BBC Two Scotland aired the programme on four nights only, running its own Gaelic-language programming on Thursdays instead.\\n\\nSeries overview\\nSeriesContestantsEpisodesOriginally airedWinnersRunners-upFirst airedLast aired18915\\xa0May\\xa02004\\xa0(2004-05-15)3\\xa0July\\xa02004\\xa0(2004-07-03)Natasha Kaplinsky & Brendan ColeChristopher Parker & Hanna Karttunen2101623\\xa0October\\xa02004\\xa0(2004-10-23)11\\xa0December\\xa02004\\xa0(2004-12-11)Jill Halfpenny & Darren BennettDenise Lewis & Ian Waite3122015\\xa0October\\xa02005\\xa0(2005-10-15)17\\xa0December\\xa02005\\xa0(2005-12-17)Darren Gough & Lilia KopylovaColin Jackson & Erin Boag414247\\xa0October\\xa02006\\xa0(2006-10-07)23\\xa0December\\xa02006\\xa0(2006-12-23)Mark Ramprakash & Karen HardyMatt Dawson & Lilia Kopylova514246\\xa0October\\xa02007\\xa0(2007-10-06)22\\xa0December\\xa02007\\xa0(2007-12-22)Alesha Dixon & Matthew CutlerMatt Di Angelo & Flavia Cacace6162820\\xa0September\\xa02008\\xa0(2008-09-20)20\\xa0December\\xa02008\\xa0(2008-12-20)Tom Chambers & Camilla DallerupRachel Stevens & Vincent Simone7161918\\xa0September\\xa02009\\xa0(2009-09-18)19\\xa0December\\xa02009\\xa0(2009-12-19)Chris Hollins & Ola JordanRicky Whittle & Natalie Lowe814261\\xa0October\\xa02010\\xa0(2010-10-01)18\\xa0December\\xa02010\\xa0(2010-12-18)Kara Tointon & Artem ChigvintsevMatt Baker & Aliona Vilani9142530\\xa0September\\xa02011\\xa0(2011-09-30)17\\xa0December\\xa02011\\xa0(2011-12-17)Harry Judd & Aliona VilaniChelsee Healey & Pasha Kovalev1014255\\xa0October\\xa02012\\xa0(2012-10-05)22\\xa0December\\xa02012\\xa0(2012-12-22)Louis Smith & Flavia CacaceDenise van Outen & James JordanKimberley Walsh & Pasha Kovalev11152727\\xa0September\\xa02013\\xa0(2013-09-27)21\\xa0December\\xa02013\\xa0(2013-12-21)Abbey Clancy & Aljaž ŠkorjanecNatalie Gumede & Artem ChigvintsevSusanna Reid & Kevin Clifton12152726\\xa0September\\xa02014\\xa0(2014-09-26)20\\xa0December\\xa02014\\xa0(2014-12-20)Caroline Flack & Pasha KovalevFrankie Bridge & Kevin CliftonSimon Webbe & Kristina Rihanoff13152725\\xa0September\\xa02015\\xa0(2015-09-25)19\\xa0December\\xa02015\\xa0(2015-12-19)Jay McGuiness & Aliona VilaniGeorgia May Foote & Giovanni PerniceKellie Bright & Kevin Clifton14152623\\xa0September\\xa02016\\xa0(2016-09-23)17\\xa0December\\xa02016\\xa0(2016-12-17)Ore Oduba & Joanne CliftonDanny Mac & Oti MabuseLouise Redknapp & Kevin Clifton15152523\\xa0September\\xa02017\\xa0(2017-09-23)16\\xa0December\\xa02017\\xa0(2017-12-16)Joe McFadden & Katya JonesAlexandra Burke & Gorka MárquezDebbie McGee & Giovanni PerniceGemma Atkinson & Aljaž Skorjanec16152522\\xa0September\\xa02018\\xa0(2018-09-22)15\\xa0December\\xa02018\\xa0(2018-12-15)Stacey Dooley & Kevin CliftonAshley Roberts & Pasha KovalevFaye Tozer & Giovanni PerniceJoe Sugg & Dianne Buswell17152521\\xa0September\\xa02019\\xa0(2019-09-21)14\\xa0December\\xa02019\\xa0(2019-12-14)Kelvin Fletcher & Oti MabuseEmma Barton & Anton Du BekeKarim Zeroual & Amy Dowden18121724\\xa0October\\xa02020\\xa0(2020-10-24)19\\xa0December\\xa02020\\xa0(2020-12-19)Bill Bailey & Oti MabuseHRVY & Janette ManraraJamie Laing & Karen HauerMaisie Smith & Gorka Márquez19152525\\xa0September\\xa02021\\xa0(2021-09-25)18\\xa0December\\xa02021\\xa0(2021-12-18)Rose Ayling-Ellis & Giovanni PerniceJohn Whaite & Johannes Radebe20152524\\xa0September\\xa02022\\xa0(2022-09-24)17\\xa0December\\xa02022\\xa0(2022-12-17)Hamza Yassin & Jowita PrzystałFleur East & Vito CoppolaHelen Skelton & Gorka MárquezMolly Rainford & Carlos Gu21152523\\xa0September\\xa02023\\xa0(2023-09-23)16\\xa0December\\xa02023\\xa0(2023-12-16)Ellie Leach & Vito CoppolaBobby Brazier & Dianne BuswellLayton Williams & Nikita Kuzmin2215TBA21\\xa0September\\xa02024\\xa0(2024-09-21)14\\xa0December\\xa02024\\xa0(2024-12-14)TBATBA\\nSeries 1 (2004)\\nMain article: Strictly Come Dancing (series 1)\\nIn May 2004, Strictly Come Dancing began its first series.

Strictly took over a hotel near the studios and the pro dancers learnt and filmed all the group routines for the series at once.[83] This allowed for the show to still include the professional group dances each week. On 21 August 2020, it was announced that Bruno Tonioli would not be on the judging panel but would appear virtually while he filmed Dancing with the Stars in the US. It was the first series since 2012 to begin in October.[84] On 12 November 2020, Nicola Adams and Katya Jones were forced to withdraw from the competition after Jones tested positive for COVID-19.[85] On 19 December 2020, Bill Bailey and Oti Mabuse were crowned the winners of the series, making Mabuse the second professional dancer to win the show twice and the first to win it consecutively, following her 2019 victory. This series featured the first all-female and same-sex partnership of Nicola Adams and Katya Jones.\\n\\n\\n\\nCelebrity\\n\\nNotability\\n\\nProfessional partner\\n\\nResult\\n\\n\\nJacqui Smith\\n\\nLabour Party politician\\n\\nAnton Du Beke\\n\\nEliminated 1st\\n\\n\\nJason Bell\\n\\nNFL player & pundit\\n\\nLuba Mushtuk\\n\\nEliminated 2nd\\n\\n\\nNicola Adams\\n\\nOlympic boxer\\n\\nKatya Jones\\n\\nWithdrew\\n\\n\\nMax George\\n\\nThe Wanted singer\\n\\nDianne Buswell\\n\\nEliminated 3rd\\n\\n\\nCaroline Quentin\\n\\nActress & television presenter\\n\\nJohannes Radebe\\n\\nEliminated 4th\\n\\n\\nClara Amfo\\n\\nBBC Radio 1 presenter\\n\\nAljaž Škorjanec\\n\\nEliminated 5th\\n\\n\\nJJ Chalmers\\n\\nTelevision presenter & Invictus Games medallist\\n\\nAmy Dowden\\n\\nEliminated 6th\\n\\n\\nRanvir Singh\\n\\nGood Morning Britain presenter & journalist\\n\\nGiovanni Pernice\\n\\nEliminated 7th\\n\\n\\nHRVY\\n\\nSinger & television presenter\\n\\nJanette Manrara\\n\\nRunners-up\\n\\n\\nJamie Laing\\n\\nMade in Chelsea star\\n\\nKaren Hauer\\n\\n\\nMaisie Smith\\n\\nEastEnders actress\\n\\nGorka Márquez\\n\\n\\nBill Bailey\\n\\nComedian, musician & actor\\n\\nOti Mabuse\\n\\nWinners\\n\\nSeries 19 (2021)\\nMain article: Strictly Come Dancing (series 19)\\nOn 10 June 2021, it was announced that Janette Manrara would leave the show as a professional dancer and replace Zoe Ball as a new It Takes Two presenter. On 24 June, Anton Du Beke was announced as having joined the judging panel for this series instead of returning as a professional dancer, replacing Bruno Tonioli, who missed a second year due to continuing travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the remaining fourteen professional dancers from Series 18, all of whom returned for this series, four new professional dancers joined the show: Cameron Lombard, Jowita Przystał, Kai Widdrington and Nikita Kuzmin.[86]\\nThis series marked the first time that two contestants withdrew from the competition.

These have included seasonal specials, charity specials, and variations of the Strictly Come Dancing format.\\n\\nStrictly Come Dancing Live!\\nMain article: Strictly Come Dancing Live!\\nStrictly Come Dancing Live! is a nationwide arena tour staged every year since 2008.[90]\\n\\nControversies\\n2008 semi-final\\nOn 13 December 2008, Strictly Come Dancing became the subject of press attention and viewer complaints about an error in the voting system during the semi-final of series six. In the show, three couples remained in the competition. After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position on the leaderboard, while the third — Tom Chambers and Camilla Dallerup — were in last place. This meant that, no matter how many public votes were cast in their favour, it was mathematically impossible for the third-placed couple to avoid the dance-off. This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote. Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final, all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition, and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished.[91]\\nThe BBC received 1800 complaints about the incident,[92] while media regulator Ofcom received 297.[91] Jon Beazley, the BBC\\'s Head of Entertainment Production, was interviewed on Strictly\\'s spin-off show Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two on 15 December. He apologised for the oversight, referring to it as an \"unprecedented situation\". On the same day, the BBC posted a statement on its website, which clarified that an independent adjudicator had been consulted to reach a solution that would offer \"fairness to the viewers who voted and the contestants themselves\".[93] The BBC also stated that, following the mistake, \"the voting and judging mechanisms used in all BBC voting programmes [had] been thoroughly examined\".[91]\\nAfter conducting an investigation, Ofcom concluded that \"the mistake had resulted from an oversight, rather than any shortcomings in the technical arrangements for voting or in the handling of votes received\", and that they were \"satisfied that appropriate steps were taken by the BBC and the disadvantage to viewers minimised\". Ofcom also opined that \"the BBC had been open and transparent with viewers about the mistake it made and the solution adopted\".[91]\\n\\nSacking of Arlene Phillips\\nIn June 2009, tabloid newspaper The Sun reported that the then 66-year-old judge Arlene Phillips, who had judged the show since its inception in 2004, was to be replaced by series five winner Alesha Dixon, then aged 30.[94] This was later confirmed by the BBC in July of that year.[95] Subsequently, the BBC was accused of ageism and sexism by several sources,[95][96] an accusation the corporation has faced before over the removal of several older female presenters, including Moira Stuart,[97] Juliet Morris,[98] Miriam O\\'Reilly,[98][97] Michaela Strachan,[98] Charlotte Smith[98] and Anna Ford.[99] The BBC denied the allegations that the decision to remove Phillips was due to her age.[95]\\nFurthermore, Dixon herself was criticised after the debut episode of the seventh series, the first to feature her as a judge. A total of 272 complaints were received by the BBC – bringing the total number about Dixon joining the programme to over 4000 – along with over 5000 comments on Strictly Come Dancing\\'s internet message board.[100] Dixon was compared unfavourably to Phillips, with claims that the former was \"unsuitable\", \"unqualified\" and lacked \"knowledge, experience and talent\".[100] However, Dixon was praised and defended from her critics by the BBC,[100] by fellow judge Craig Revel Horwood[100] and by Phillips herself.[101]\\n\\n2009 racism scandal\\nIn 2009, during the seventh series, professional dancer Anton Du Beke issued a public apology[102] for his use of a racial slur during a conversation with his dance partner Laila Rouass.[103] Rouass accepted his apology and said that he should \"[a]bsolutely not\" be fired: \"Anton has apologised and I\\'ve accepted it. This happened a couple of weeks ago now and we are just having a really good time. We just want to move on from it.\"[104] Over 600 complaints were received by the BBC, including those about comments Bruce Forsyth, then host of Strictly Come Dancing, made about the controversy on a Talksport radio programme, in which he suggested that Britain \"used to have a sense of humour\" about such incidents, and that Du Beke\\'s apology should be accepted.[105]\\n\\nFollowing the incident, and Forsyth\\'s response, the BBC stated:Racially offensive language in the workplace is entirely unacceptable. Anton was right to apologise quickly and without reservation and Laila has wholly accepted his apology. Everyone is very clear that there can be no repetition of this behaviour.[105]Forsyth also clarified his position:What Anton said to Laila was wrong and he has apologised unreservedly for this. Nor do I in any way excuse or condone the use of such language. To be absolutely clear, the use of racially offensive language is never either funny or acceptable. However, there is a major difference between this and racist comments which are malicious in intent and whilst I accept that we live in a world of extraordinary political correctness, we should keep things in perspective.[105]\\nSame-sex couples\\nIn 2015, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, Egghead C. J. de Mooi said that he was turned down for the show because he had wanted to dance with a same-sex partner.[106]  The BBC denied that de Mooi had ever been under consideration for the show,[107] and also declared that \"Strictly is a family show and we have chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples\".[106] The press has reported on the issue on numerous occasions when gay celebrities have appeared on the show, including Will Young,[108] Susan Calman,[109] Robert Rinder,[110] Richard Coles[111] and Ranj Singh.[112] Strictly Come Dancing judges Shirley Ballas[112] and Craig Revel Horwood[113] have both expressed their support for introducing same-sex couples.\\nSame-sex partnerships have been featured on several international versions of the show, including Austria (2011), Italy (2015), Australia (2019) and Germany (2019).[114][115][116] On 3 November 2019, Johannes Radebe and fellow professional Graziano Di Prima performed together to Emeli Sandé\\'s \"Shine\" on the Sunday results episode, the show\\'s first individual same-sex dance.[117] On 2 September 2020, it was announced that boxer Nicola Adams would feature in the show\\'s first same-sex couple for its eighteenth series.[118] She was partnered with professional dancer Katya Jones. In 2021, it was announced that John Whaite would feature in the first all-male same-sex couple with Johannes Radebe for the nineteenth series.[119] The United States version of the show would also have a same-sex couple that same year, with JoJo Siwa & Jenna Johnson. Series 20 also included same-sex partnerships with Richie Anderson and Giovanni Pernice in an all-male partnership and Jayde Adams and Karen Hauer in an all-female partnership. [citation needed] In Series 21, Layton Williams and Nikita Kuzmin competed as an all-male partnership, finishing as one of two runners up.\\n\\nProfessional dancers\\' misconduct\\nIn January 2024, The Sun reported that Amanda Abbington requested footage of her time training with Giovanni Pernice and was seeking legal advice over his training methods.[120] In March 2024, The Sun said that Abbington, Laura Whitmore and Ranvir Singh had met to discuss their negative experiences with Pernice on the show. Legal firm Carter Ruck told BBC News there were \"numerous serious complaints\" about his behaviour while filming Strictly Come Dancing.[121] On 16 May, it was reported by The Sun that Pernice had quit the show. Pernice denied all accusations of wrongdoing. His departure was confirmed by the BBC on 10 June.[122]\\nIn July 2024, the BBC\\'s probe into misconduct brought further claims made by production staff, who observed Graziano Di Prima\\'s behaviour towards dance partner Zara McDermott during the 2023 series. A source speaking to The Sun claimed that footage showing Di Prima\\'s alleged treatment of McDermott \"reduced those who have seen it to tears\".[123] In a statement Di Prima said that he \"deeply regretted his actions that led to his departure from [the show]\".[124] The BBC has announced that Di Prima has left the show, and in the future a member of the production team would be present at all times during rehearsals.[125]\\nA third professional dancer has been identified as a \"person of interest\".[126]\\n\\nRatings\\nAn example of Strictly Come Dancing\\'s popularity is that, after episodes, electricity use in the United Kingdom rises significantly as viewers who have waited for the show to end begin boiling water for tea, a phenomenon known as TV pick-up. National Grid personnel watch the show to know when closing credits begin so they can prepare for the surge.[127]\\nAll ratings are from BARB.

Publishing and developed by Exient Entertainment. The game uses a mix of hand animation and motion-captured data for all the dances in the game, using pro dancers from the show (Chloe Hewitt and Neil Jones). The mo-cap process was featured on It Takes Two in the build-up to the release of the app. The game features over 150 dresses and 9 dances: Quickstep, Jive, Tango, Salsa, Charleston, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha Cha Cha, and Paso Doble. It was released on the App Store and Google Play in early 2016 and is regularly updated with new dance features alongside new seasons of the show.[204]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nTelevision portalUnited Kingdom portal\\nJust the Two of Us (TV series) – the same format, with singing instead of dancing\\nLet\\'s Dance for Comic Relief\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ Richard Hopkins Archived 11 January 2018 at the Wayback Machine The Telegraph, 12 January 2012\\n\\n^ Strictly Come Dancing producer Richard Hopkins dies Archived 12 January 2012 at the Wayback Machine; BBC News, 9 January 2012\\n\\n^ Smith, Karen. \"Must see XpoNorth Panellists\".
