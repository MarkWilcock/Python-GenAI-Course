Executive Summary \\n1.1 This Medium-Term Financial Strategy (MTFS) is intended to set out the Council’s \\nstrategic approach to the management of its finances and provide a framework within \\nwhich decisions can be made regarding future service provision and council tax \\nlevels. \\n1.2 It is based on a five-year rolling forecast from 2024/25 to 2028/29 and is intended to \\nbe reviewed annually (usually in November but delayed this year awaiting the \\noutcome of the Local Government Finance Settlement). The MTFS provides the \\nfinancial context for the Council’s financial resource allocation and budget setting \\nprocesses. \\n1.3 CIPFA has published a Financial Management Code (the FM Code) to support good \\nfinancial management. The FM Code emphasises the need for robust arrangements \\nto ensure financial sustainability. This Medium-Term Financial Strategy forms a key \\npart of those arrangements. \\n1.4 During 2023/24 the Council’s financial position has been impacted by the impact of \\ninflationary pressures but this has been offset by additional income from \\ninvestments. The forecast outturn for 2023/24 (as reported to Council on 14 \\nDecember 2023) results in a forecast underspending of £795,579 for 2023/24. It has \\nbeen agreed that if that underspending remains at the year-end then it will be \\ntransferred to specific reserves. \\n1.5 For improved financial resilience, it is recommended in the report on the revenue \\nbudget (to be presented to Council for approval on 29th February 2024) that the \\nWorking Balance should be increased to £1.4m (which requires a transfer of \\n£400,000 from the General Reserve). \\n1.6 Since 2013/14 all local authorities have faced significant reductions in Government \\nfunding, although there have been some small increases in recent years. By 2024/25 \\nthe Council’s annual Settlement Funding Assessment (the main source of \\ngovernment grant funding that includes Revenue Support Grant and Business Rates \\nBaseline Funding) will have reduced by 51% or £1.9m from 2013/14. This equates \\nto £54 per band D property.  \\n1.7 The impact of changes in the economy (such as from changes in inflation and \\ninterest rates) bring more uncertainty and instability, as does the potential outcome \\nof the Government’s Fair Funding Review and changes to the system of Business \\nRates Retention, which are expected to be announced in late 2025.  \\n1.8 The Council has responded well to the grant cuts in the past and has already made \\nsavings (or raised additional income from fees and charges) of over £2.7 million \\nsince 1st April 2014. At the same time, public expectations are increasing, there are \\ncost pressures arising from increased demand on some services, such as \\nhomelessness, and there are additional costs relating to corporate priorities, such as \\nthe cost of becoming carbon neutral.
